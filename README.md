# tic tac toe
On this day, I built a tic-tac-toe game. <br>
The first player is you, and the other player is the computer <br>
(further improvement is to build a smart AI to choose a good cell for the computer). <br>
The game will start by choosing your sign randomly <br>

You have to choose an empty cell. If you choose one that is not empty, you will get this message: <br>

Once there is a winner, or the board is full the game end, and you will be asked if you want another round. <br>
